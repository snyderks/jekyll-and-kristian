    I'm a <a href="https://github.com/{{site.github_username}}">developer</a> and computer science student at the <a href="http://uc.edu">University of Cincinnati</a>, expecting to graduate around 2020.
    I've worked in full-stack web development with C#/.NET, <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> 
    and JavaScript frameworks like <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a>.
</p>
<p>
    At the moment, I'm interested in information security and iOS app development in React Native.
