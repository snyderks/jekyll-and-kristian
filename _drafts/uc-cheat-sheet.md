**Note when this was written. I have a feeling most of this will carry over, but
a lot will change as the structure of UC does.**

College is interesting. College isn't entirely the working world but isn't the
same as high school and below, where you have a lot of structure and easy
guidance. Go to the same classes every day, go to your club or sport or band or
all three after class, do your homework, and wake up too damn early for a
16-year-old. Normal stuff. However, lots of people are dropped into college with
too little guidance and far too much freedom. While I can't do anything about
the latter, I hope this can help with some of the most important things.

At this point I need to specify that this advice, while
not entirely specific to a Bachelor's of Computer Science degree at the
University of Cincinnati, contains many points that don't transfer between
majors or schools, so you may have to do some sifting to find what is most
applicable. 

*This is also entirely my opinion. A significant portion of this talks about
class structure and planning, so take it at your own risk.* 

Anyway, this will be organized into three sections: curriculum, scheduling, and
co-op, with some overlap. Let's get going.

Hold on, hold on. This is long and I want to get one thing out of the way: **do
not take classes during any summer semester.** This is *not* a hard and fast
rule, but I *strongly* advise against it as you will see in the Scheduling and
Co-op sections.

## Curriculum

### Calculus I and CS1

Lots of people will come in with credit for Calc I and CS1 and may be unsure of
whether to claim it or not. I recommend:

- Skip Calc I if you can (AP Calculus AB with a 4-5 is plenty)
- *Do not* skip CS1, especially if you didn't get a 5 on the AP exam

Math classes, in my opinion, are far more painful in college than high school.
You may decide to retake it for a GPA boost, but *only do this if you are highly
confident in your abilities or have a good support network.* Professors can vary
widely and you may not have a good fit just due to chance.

CS1, meanwhile, should be taken by essentially everyone in my opinion, even if
you can test out of it. Again, teaching styles are going to be *very* different
in college, and CS1 is just easy enough to be a great training ground. Make
friends and work hard in this one as you learn the ropes of how a CS-style class
is taught.

### The Core Path

When looking at the curriculum sheet, you will have no clue most of the time
what actually has a prerequisite and what you can take whenever. There actually
aren't that many dependency layers for CS classes. Below is a list of them, with the class to
reach the next layer (it's usually a single one) bolded. Also: you may be able
to split levels several times, as level 3 has many classes that only require one
of the level 2 pre reqs.

1. **CS1100 (CS1, Intro to Comp Sci),** CS5001/5002 (Senior Design) (no,
   really), CS5165 (Cloud Computing), CS5170 (Automata)
2. **CS2011 (Comp Sys)**, CS2021 (Python), **CS2028C (Data Structures)**
3. **CS3003 (Prog Langs),** CS4033 (AI), CS4065 (Networks), CS4071 (Algos), most
   CS5XXX classes

This is, of course, a literal dependency layer and not a suggestion—you
shouldn't take Automata with CS1!!! However, for those with most electives
covered, this can be very useful to filling a semester.

### Electives

In my opinion, don't take any classes you don't need. I realize this goes
against the academic philosophy of becoming well-rounded, but you may regret it
when you have assignments and exams for your "fun" classes.

To sum this up in one sentence: **use all the AP credit you can and take
electives you actually find interesting.**

### Being Ahead

Being ahead of the program is difficult at UC because your outlook to future 
semesters beyond what *The Sheet* says is a big ol' ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. Your advisor
doesn't know, your friends don't know, no one can be sure. However, here's some
tips to schedule your classes.

1. Look every semester at what is available. If a class is available that
   semester, it probably will be next year, so make a note.
2. Try to constantly plan 2+ semesters in advance. This allows you to make
   changes and be dynamic if necessary.
3. Look at what earlier graduates' *The Sheets* say. If it says they take
   Automata next spring, there'll be room for you.
4. Schedule ASAP. You don't have a lot of leeway but you have enough credits to
   get early registration, so take advantage of that!
5. Plan your co-ops for when you don't have many classes available.

### ACCEND

Thinking about ACCEND? Awesome! It's not only an easy way to get a grad degree
without a GRE *shiver* but also can help fill out your course load if you're
ahead. 

There are three options: MS (thesis), MEng (classes replacing the 9 hours
of thesis), and MBA. If you're looking to reduce your debt load, MS offers a
significant scholarship at ~$9K/year, MEng is about half of that, and MBA has no
CEAS scholarship, although the CoB may offer something. 

I would recommend, given the option to eliminate a co-op, to avoid that if
possible. Co-ops are a huge reason to be at UC and losing that is big. However,
if you can't get done in 5 years any other way, it may be worth it.

When scheduling classes, I would recommend taking 1-2 graduate *electives* that
apply each semester. To find out what applies, *see your advisor in person.* The
Degree Audit is usually accurate, but not perfectly. Unless you can handle it,
*do not take core classes until you're full-time grad* and you can give all your
time to them, because you cannot have below a B average.

## Scheduling

### The Sheet

Every single CS year at UC has a *The Sheet* that gives a *suggested* course
path for every student. However, do not consider this to be a command but a
guideline. If you aren't coming in with any credits, it can save a ton of time
to just go off the sheet. However, if you have any AP credit, you should plan on
your own to avoid extra semesters you may not need.

### When Should I Start Planning?

Immediately! Missing out on optimizing your course schedule early can be
catastrophic because you can be forced into a specific track later that isn't a
good fit. Again, if you have *any college credit,* give some serious thought to
going off your *The Sheet.*

### Double Co-op Semesters

Why isn't this under co-op? *Because it's all about scheduling.* A double
semester of co-op is great for two reasons: it gets you more work experience
with fewer transitions to and from school and *it can help avoid summer
semester.* 

Both summer through fall and spring through summer doubles are good,
with the former being easier early and the latter falling naturally into most
schedules later.

I recommend them heavily. If a company will keep you for that long or if you can
find two separate positions, *do it.*

### Senior Design

**Senior design must be taken as two consecutive (your last) semesters.** You
may have heard about ways to get around this: they no longer exist. Keep this
always in the back of your mind as you schedule, because this can totally screw
up your graduation date. No one wants to be a *full year* delayed with only two
classes left.

### Summers

This is probably my most controversial point but is the reason I wrote this:
avoid summer semester like the **plague.** Even if you're going off your *The
Sheet* for everything else, figure out how to be on co-op for all of them. You
will have three summer semesters to figure out for this (your first summer
semester is forced to not have classes, so take a break or do an internship or
whatever). Summer semesters have three problems:

1. Tons of your friends will be on co-op (because they did this!)
2. Course selection is minimal for CS especially
3. This is when most companies have their *internship* programs

You may ask, why do I care about internship programs? Well, most companies don't
hire interns or co-ops outside the summer semester because the demand for
alternate times is so much lower. To really get some great co-ops, you want to
be available in the summer.

## Co-op

### Begin Early

Most companies begin recruiting for *summer* interns/co-ops in *September.* Does
this seem early? Yep, it is! That's because all the students want to know early
and the companies want those students. You should have a tentative list of the
ones you really want to pursue by then.

### Get Summer Co-ops

You want to work at companies in the summer. This is when you have by far the
widest selection (want to work in SF/Seattle? Apply for the summer!) and the
most fellow interns, which is great for making friends. Of course, you won't be
able to make them all during the summer, but it's a lot easier to do a double
semester if you have one be the summer and lots of places only want you during
the summer.

### Jump Around

Unless you are absolutely in love with your first co-op (wow, good job!), jump
between companies. If you need to stay for two semesters, *try and get a
different role for next time.* Breath of experience is huge.

This applies for Cincinnati as well. Give Cincinnati a try; it's a good place
for co-ops in the fall and spring especially. However, unless you have a really
good reason to stay, go to another city or even state! Now is perhaps the
easiest time before you have obligations and kids and pets and marriage and
furniture (moving sucks).

### Apply Externally

Do not rely on the career fair or PAL to get a co-op. You can get some solid
positions, yes, but other than Microsoft, essentially no one outside Greater
Cincinnati recruits at UC. You should be applying to companies directly as your
primary means of getting a job. This allows you to use PAL and the career fair,
which are not nearly as effective, as second options.

### Co-op Pay

There's really bad info on both ends of the scale for co-op pay. However, here's
some good rules of thumb for co-op pay so you know approximately what you can
make:

|              | Cincinnati                  | Big Tech                    |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1st-2nd Year | Low: $10 Mid: $15 High: $25 | Low: $20 Mid: $30 High: $50 |
| 3rd-5th Year | Low: $10 Mid: $20 High: $30 | Low: $25 Mid: $35 High: $60 |

NOTE: This does not mean that everyone can or will make $25/hr in Cincinnati or
$50/hr in SF as a freshman. More competitive programs will have higher pay and a
smaller company typically can't pay as much.

A final note: if you are thinking of going out of Cincinnati and *especially if
you are living in a large metro area,* your company should be providing housing
in most cases. This seems like a lot, but your pay can go to zero very quickly
if you have to find a short-term lease.

## Final Thoughts

I imagine everyone reading this will see a part that they think is obvious.
However, I have a feeling this won't be the same part for most of us. I knew
about 60% of this coming in, but things like the summer semester, ACCEND, and
intro courses I either lucked into or had to figure out.

If any of this information is inaccurate due to time or me being wrong, send me
an email! I'll be happy to correct it.
