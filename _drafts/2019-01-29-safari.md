description: Why web standards aren't what you think they are
---

**Edit:** as some clarification, the idea of a "web standard" is nebulous. 
Even [Level 3 CSS Selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-selectors-3-20181106/)
(things like `element:nth-child`) got standardized in November 2018 while 
being widely used and almost assumed as existing and most of the below features
are implemented by the WebKit/Apple team in Safari now.

While Safari is (sometimes much) later to the party than other browsers, with
Chrome usually the fastest to implementation, they usually implement
features a year after the Working Group is formed, when it looks like the ideas
are beginning to be nailed down. 

My concern is that, when people refer to "web standards," they overwhelmingly
mean "whatever Chrome does" without even realizing it because they *never use
anything else.* This speaks to a dangerous hegemony of Chrome that will, in
the long run, hurt the idea of the web as a free place and, instead, be a world
of only "this site works in Chrome."

Original post continues below.

This starts, of course, with a 
[Hacker News comment saying Safari is the new IE.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19024609)
Let's think, briefly, of some of the main complaints. Oh, look, another
comment, [this one from 2016!](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12052549)

Here's all the things they complained about:

- No [WebRTC](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/)
- [Service Workers](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/) not implemented
(as of this post, Safari has some implementation of it)
- No WebM/VP8 support
- No [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/bikeshed/index.html)
or [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/) (Safari has WASM, not asm.js)
- No [MediaRecorder](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-record/MediaRecorder.html)

And in the first comment, they complain about Safari "not implementing standards."

In 2016, **none of the above points were standardized.** Not almost none, 
but **none.** Today? **Still none.**

All of these (except WebM, which is just a media format) are at
the level of [Working Draft or Editor's Draft](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7661387).
No working draft is part of the W3C web standard. They are for review by
the community, which seems obvious with the name *working draft.*

## The Chrome Problem

However, if you search [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) (a great resource for
determining what web features are supported by what browsers), you'll notice
that almost all of them are completely supported by Chrome (and usually
Firefox) while *not in the W3C specification.* In fact, most of the hot
web features in use today are not in the spec; even Flexbox is just a
[Candidate Recommendation!](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)

What this means is a lot of web developers are depending on features that
are not only still being revised, but aren't implemented by anyone but Chrome.
This is a dangerous trend that has only been getting worse because both
people above assumed that, despite the contrary,
*Chrome is the spec.* And for lots of people, it is!
Not many people test in Firefox anymore, let alone Safari.

If we're going to complain continually about having to implement workarounds
for Safari, Firefox, and Edge[^1], we must at least be honest that it isn't
about standards. It's about not doing exactly the same things as Chrome,
even if what Chrome implements is still *years away from being defined.*
