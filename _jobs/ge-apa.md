Worked to manage enterprise data software deployment, orchestration, and monitoring in AWS, saving GE **>$500M** in server costs across the team.

- Used Chef to automate deployment and setup of application containers on EC2
- Wrote JS/TS on Lambda to manage monitoring with automated alerts in team chat channels and on-demand triggering of deployment.
- Tested database calls, API functionality, unit tests with BDD in Mocha/Chai
