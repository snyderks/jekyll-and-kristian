    Hi, I'm Kristian. I'm a student at the University of Cincinnati and developer. What kind? Lots of kinds.
</p>

<p>
    Right now, I build things for the web, from database integration all the way through to UI design, using a microservices approach.
</p>

<p>
    My current side project is a service to build personalized playlists that sound better than hitting shuffle.
    It's called Spotkov. Check out the code here.
</p>

<p>
    My main languages include C#, Go, ES6, Python, and C++.
</p>

<p>
    I've worked on projects in .NET, Vue.js, and Angular, using libraries like Redis, RabbitMQ, MS SQL Server, Plotly, and Jekyll.
