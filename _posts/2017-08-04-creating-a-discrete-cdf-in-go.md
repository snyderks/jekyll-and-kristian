Random array selection is easy: in Go, create a slice, figure out its length, generate a random integer from `0` up to `length - 1`, and retrieve the item. *Weighted* selection is a little harder, but using a CDF is a quick way to accomplish it.

Let's say that we like mechanical keyboards. So much, in fact, that we can't decide which one to buy next. First, create a [slice](https://gobyexample.com/slices):

```golang
keebs := []string{"Ducky Shine", "IBM Model M", "CM Storm Quickfire", "Pok3r", "WASD v2"}
```
