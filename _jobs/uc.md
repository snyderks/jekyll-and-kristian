* Led update of [UC department's website](http://www.uc.edu/cetl.html) with
  responsive layout and modern design
* Created dynamically updating calendar sourcing from internal API using Yahoo
  Query Language, jQuery

I learned a great deal from this position about working in a team, balancing a
detailed design with usability, and staying true to a consistent design of the
overall site.

The university environment, additionally, provided me with the skills to ask
questions of others and complete my tasks with departmental approval, heavily
applicable to companies large and small.
